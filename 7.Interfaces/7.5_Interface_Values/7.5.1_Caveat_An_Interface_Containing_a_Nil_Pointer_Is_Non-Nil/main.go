// The  problem  is  that  although  a  nil  *bytes.Buffer  pointer  has  the  methods
// needed to satisfy the interface, it doesnâ€™t satisfy the behavioral requirements of the
// interface.

// The solution is to change the type of buf in main to io.Writer,
// thereby  avoiding  the  assignment  of  the  dysfunctional  value  to  the
// interface in the first place
