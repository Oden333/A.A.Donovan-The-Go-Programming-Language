package whyreflection

// Go provides a mechanism to update variables and inspect their values at run time, to
// call  their  methods,  and  to  apply  the  operations  intrinsic  to  their  representation,  all
// without  knowing  their  types  at  compile  time.
// This  mechanism  is  called  reflection.
// Reflection also lets us treat types themselves as first-class values
